    646174: 'It was my early London days around 1979 and there was a club called Blitz where all the Neo Romantics and punks would meet. They would come from all over England, all dressed up, because Steve Strange, whose club it was, would not let them in unless they had style, panache, whatever. Anyway, one day Steven called me at home and said, ‘David Bowie\'s coming in tonight. I want you to be the only photographer upstairs with him.’ I think, shit, David Bowie. Okay. So, I get all dressed up and go, and I\'m upstairs and I checked the camera. There\'s no film in it. Oh my God I forgot the film, I was so nervous to meet David Bowie. So, my friend runs out down to Piccadilly to buy some film at the chemist, comes back, I load the film, and while I\'m loading the film, Bowie walks in and sits at the couch opposite me. So I load and just raise the camera and take a photo. He looks at me and beckons me over and says, ‘Don\'t you know it\'s impolite not to ask someone before you take their photograph?’ So, I\'m sort of shaking in my boots and said, ‘Oh, look, I\'m really sorry, Mr. Bowie, the flash just went off.’ And then I look at him and really sheepishly and say, ‘Can I please take another one?’ And he smiles and says, ‘Of course.’',

Of course, I said yes, I jumped at the chance to work. Sydney was now starting to get vibey and people were much more attuned to the fashion industry, and the nightclubs were great, everything about it was perfect for me.\n' +
        'A portrait would never last more than 30 minutes at the most, people would lose interest, they\'d be tired. When they came to the studio I would have the big Nikon cameras, tripods, a couple of lamps. I only had two lamps: a red head and some other old lamp that somebody gave me. I really liked natural lighting so I would always use the window as part of the portrait.',

And what do you do?’ And Michael said, ‘Oh, I\'m a singer,’ and Michelle said, ‘I\'m a model.’ I just turned to one side and said, ‘If I meet another singer and another model in Australia, I\'m going to scream.’ We became friends over that because I was just perfectly natural. I didn\'t know who he was. I\'d just come back from London. After that, Harper\'s Bazaar asked me to do portraits of people wearing their favourite outfits. I asked the editor and a few friends ‘Who\'s the most famous rock star in Australia?’ because I wanted to do all different walks of life. And a few of them said, Michael Hutchence and I said, ‘Oh no, that\'s the guy I was rude to.’ I managed to contact him through his agent, and he said, ‘Yes, of course.’ And he came to the studio and he brought with him his favourite things. You can see on the hat there\'s a little mini car, and the hat and the badges. These are things that fans threw to him on stage, and he kept.',
    645894: 'I heard Yoko was coming to Sydney for the Biennale, so I asked the PR if she could contact Yoko to have a private portrait session. Yoko replied that no, she was a bit shy, she didn\'t know me. So, I turn up at the press conference thinking, I\'m going to get this portrait. I opened my camera case and I said, ‘Look, I\'ve brought a backdrop with me, give me five minutes with her.’ Of course, there\'s two security guards there, so I got them to hold the black cloth behind Yoko, took the photographs and then she said, ‘Would you like a cup of tea or coffee?’ So, we sat down, we had some coffee and we just talked and talked about London, the old days, and everything. And then there\'s a banging on the door ‘Robert, I told you, five minutes.’ The door opens the PR\'s bursting in, there\'s TV crews waiting outside. I said, ‘Okay, I\'m sorry.’ Yoko had given me her address in New York to send a couple of prints to because she wanted to see them. So, I did. And she sent me a beautiful Christmas card with a John Lennon drawing on it, thanking me for the photograph and saying that she really liked it.',
    645327: 'I think I was influenced to start the Polaroid collection by Andy Warhol. When I met him in London, he was shooting Polaroids around the parties. And I was just intrigued by this strange looking camera and these photos that it would just spit out instantly, and they would develop within about one minute. I took the Polaroid camera everywhere with me in my pocket. So, if there was somebody quite famous, I would whip it out and say, ‘Let\'s do a Polaroid.’\n' +
        'This Polaroid of David Bowie was taken at Regine’s nightclub at a party in the afternoon. I went up to him and said, ‘Could I take a Polaroid of you?’ And he said, ‘Yes, sure, let\'s just go over here behind the bushes.’ So, we went and shot the Polaroid. He asked me my name and I said, Robert Rosen, and he replied ‘Robert Rosen with the looking glass bow tie,’ because I was wearing one of Andrew Logan\'s glass mirror bow ties. Anyway, the Polaroid photo is developing and I\'m holding it really nervously thinking any minute Bowie is going to remember me as that rude photographer at the Blitz club. The Polaroid photo developed and my thumbprint is at the top from where I was holding it so tightly. I showed it to him and said, ‘I\'m sorry, look my thumbprints on it, I think we better do another one.’ He said, ‘No, I like it. It\'s art.’'
