      "description":"<p>Unpopular draws on the never-before-seen archive of music promoter, record company founder and entrepreneur Stephen ‘Pav’ Pavlovic, taking audiences behind-the-scenes of the alternative music scene in the 1990s.</p><p>Unpopular comes from the idea that alternative music in the 1990s began as a movement that deliberately avoided the mainstream and anything popular. It became the dominant cultural movement of the 90s with artists that helped define the genre – Sonic Youth, Beastie Boys, Mudhoney, Nirvana, Bikini Kill, Fugazi, Pavement, The Lemonheads and more.</p> <p>See more than 200 objects from Pav’s extensive collection, including footage of live performances, unheard music demos and live audio recordings, photographs, original graphic art, posters and fanzines. The exhibition also features Kurt Cobain’s Martin guitar plus new commissions by artist and film maker Julian Klincewicz and artist Lillian O’Neil. </p>",

So, I get all dressed up and go, and I'm upstairs and I checked the camera. There's no film in it. Oh my God I forgot the film, I was so nervous to meet David Bowie. So, my friend runs out down to Piccadilly to buy some film at the chemist, comes back, I load the film, and while I'm loading the film, Bowie walks in and sits at the couch opposite me. So I load and just raise the camera and take a photo. He looks at me and beckons me over and says, Don't you know it's impolite not to ask someone before you take their photograph. So, I'",

          "notes3":"Michelle was just a student at East Sydney Tech when I met her and I could see she was doing great things then. I used to go to the East Sydney Tech end-of-year fashion shows and her work really stood out. This photograph was taken from the front row, of all the models just slowly, slowly, coming on, and stepping on chairs and ladders until the final shot. I'd only ever done catwalk in London and Paris so that was very exciting seeing all the models, hairdressers, makeup, everybody in a tizz, trying to get ready on time to step out onto that catwalk. I found photographing backstage much, much more exciting than photographing the catwalk because of the atmosphere and because of the quick shots I could get of people in disarray, or, looking perfect two seconds before they're about to go on the catwalk, handing a cigarette to the security, and stepping out looking immaculate.",

          "notes3":"There was a party for Liberace at Wedgie's, which was quite an upper-class nightclub on the Kings Road in Chelsea. And the photographers were leaving as I arrived, as I'm usually late anyway. And I said, ‘Is there anybody in there?’ And they said, ‘Nah, not really, just Liberace.’ And one of them piped up and said, ‘Oh, Nina Simone's in there.’ I thought what? Nina Simone, my idol, my God I've got to get in there. So, I went in, found Nina. She was sitting at a table and I asked her if I could do a Polaroid of her. And we took a Polaroid, she looked at, it said, ‘Nup, I don't like it.’ She stuck it in the candle and burnt it, held it up, looking like the Statue of Liberty, holding this flaming Polaroid. We proceeded to do about five or six after that, until she finally liked the one you're looking at. Then she said to me, ‘Sit down and talk to me.’ We had copious amounts of champagne and talked about God knows what.",

          "notes3":"I was invited by the publicist to attend the Grace Jones concert. It was at a small theatre in Sydney called the Enmore Theatre. And I don't know why, maybe because I had the camera around my neck, but the security guards just ushered me right up the front, close to the stage. And there was hardly anybody else photographing, which was great so I could move around freely. Grace Jones to me is just a vision of beauty, excitement. Every frame that I take of Grace is almost perfect. So, during the concert she had this big floaty outfit on and, I don't know why, I just kept pressing the button the whole time. So, I got this sequence of photographs.",
